## Overview

Shell-based automation for deploying containerized services in LXC containers on Proxmox VE.

**Always follow best practices and keep code clean.**

## Core Development Principles

### Fail Fast & Simple
- Ensure idempotency in all operations
- Let commands fail naturally with their original error messages
- **NEVER** use `>/dev/null 2>&1` - all output must be visible for debugging
- **EXCEPTION:** Suppress output when it interferes with command parsing (e.g., `apt-get update` output mixing with `yq`/`jq` parsing)
- **EXCEPTION:** Basic health checks are allowed when immediately needed (e.g., waiting for service to be ready before API call)
- No retry logic or waiting loops in deployment scripts
- Focus on main scenario - edge cases should fail fast

### Idempotency Without Manual Checks
- **NEVER** manually check if something exists before running idempotent commands
- Commands like `apt install`, `systemctl enable`, `mkdir -p` are already idempotent
- Always run the actual command - let it handle "already exists" cases
- Example: Use `apt install docker` directly, NOT `if ! command -v docker; then apt install docker; fi`
- This keeps scripts simple and ensures packages stay up-to-date

### Homelab-First Approach
- Static/hardcoded values must be used always if possible
- Accept that manual intervention is normal for edge cases
- Prefer simple solutions over complex error recovery

### Latest Everything
- Always use `latest` for everything in homelab context
- Version pinning only if absolutely required for compatibility

## Documentation Standards

### Minimal Documentation Philosophy
- **NO test scripts**: Do not create validation or health check scripts
- **NO extra .md files**: Keep documentation minimal - only in README.md or inline comments
- **EXCEPTION**: Critical technical notes (like GPU configuration) can have a dedicated README.md in the specific stack directory (e.g., `docker/media/README.md`)
- **Inline comments**: For important notes, use comments in the actual scripts where relevant
- **README.md**: General project documentation goes in the main README.md only

## Technical Guidelines

### Security and Encryption
Always use `-pbkdf2` and `-salt` with openssl for env file encryption/decryption.

### Environment Secrets
The repository uses encrypted `.env.enc` files for sensitive configuration. Use `ENV_ENC_KEY` from GitHub secrets (available as environment variable in CI/CD) for decryption/encryption with openssl. The same `ENV_ENC_KEY` can be used to decrypt any `.env.enc` file in the repository for inspection or modification. Always commit only `.env.enc` files, never decrypted `.env` files.

### Version Control
- **NEVER** use "Generated with [AI Tool]" in commits
- Commit as the actual developer (Yakrel), not as AI
- Always check code to ensure no secrets or passwords are committed
- **Git Configuration**: Use `git config user.email "85676216+Yakrel@users.noreply.github.com"` and `git config user.name "Yakrel"` before committing

## Project Context

This is a personal homelab automation with:
- Fixed network topology: `192.168.1.x` range
- ZFS storage pool: `datapool`
- Network bridge: `vmbr0`
- Timezone: `Europe/Istanbul`
- Unprivileged LXC containers with UID/GID mapping (101000:101000 on host â†’ 1000:1000 in container)

### LXC File Permissions
**CRITICAL: Never do chown inside LXC containers**
- Always set permissions on Proxmox host with `chown 101000:101000`
- For shared config files: `chown -R 101000:101000 /datapool/config` (this is sufficient for all LXC containers)
- **Never** chown to `/datapool` itself (parent directory) - only to `/datapool/config` or subdirectories
- Files in `/datapool/config` with host UID 101000 automatically map to UID 1000 inside unprivileged LXC containers
- Docker containers using `user: "1000:1000"` can access these files correctly without additional chown operations
